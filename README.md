# Cryptolyst

A command-line utility for identifying and decoding ciphers and text encodings, that leverages vocabulary-based analysis to evaluate potential decryptions and identify the most plausible result.

Co-authored by my friend, [Ariaa-H](https://github.com/Ariaa-H).

## Features
- Runs all supported decoders automatically.
- Brute-forces shift/key values where applicable.
- Cleans and detects various separators automatically.
- Uses dictionary-based scoring to rank plausible results.
- Supports multiple dictionaries to integrate more languages and/or precise vocabularies.

## Plausibility Ranking
The script evaluates decoded outputs against a vocabulary and assigns a *plausibility score* based on the percentage of recognized words. However, relying solely on this score can be misleading, as multiple decoding attempts might result in a high score but produce nonsensical gibberish.

For example, without a more advanced ranking system, the results might look like this:
```
100% | Base64 (RFC 3548, RFC 4648): \‚ñ∫DC (‚ô´B‚ñ∫‚ô¶N`
100% | Base64url (RFC 4648 ¬ß5): \‚ñ∫DC :‚òª@‚Äº‚òª‚ò∫:‚ô•9
100% | Original Base64 (RFC 1421): \‚ñ∫DC (‚ô´B‚ñ∫‚ô¶N`
100% | ASCII85 / Base85 (Standard): The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
```

To solve this, results that meet the **`PLAUSIBILITY_THRESHOLD`** (default: 70%) are then sorted using a more nuanced approach. The final ranking is based on three criteria in order of importance: the plausibility score, the number of spaces (favoring structured text), and the overall length. This ensures that human-readable text is prioritized over random characters, even if they have the same initial score.

With proper sorting logic, the same results are correctly ordered:
```
100% | ASCII85 / Base85 (Standard): The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
100% | Base64url (RFC 4648 ¬ß5): \‚ñ∫DC :‚òª@‚Äº‚òª‚ò∫:‚ô•9
100% | Base64 (RFC 3548, RFC 4648): \‚ñ∫DC (‚ô´B‚ñ∫‚ô¶N`
100% | Original Base64 (RFC 1421): \‚ñ∫DC (‚ô´B‚ñ∫‚ô¶N`
```

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```
You will be prompted to paste your ciphertext.

**Example:**
```
Please enter the ciphertext to decode: Olssv, ovd hyl fvb kvpun?
```

**Output:**
```
Found plausible results:
100% | Caesar Cipher (Shift: 7): Hello, how are you doing?
100% | Affine Cipher (a=1, b=7): Hello, how are you doing?
```

## Folder Structure
```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decoders.py         # All decoding and brute-force functions.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py             # Entry point and plausibility ranking.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vocabulary/         # Wordlist text files for plausibility analysis.
```

---

## Vocabulary Files
The `vocabulary` folder should contain `.txt` files with one word per line. The quality of these wordlists directly impacts the accuracy of the plausibility score.

This project uses a customized and modified version of standard wordlists for improved performance and relevance. You can use any comprehensive wordlist, such as those derived from SCOWL.
